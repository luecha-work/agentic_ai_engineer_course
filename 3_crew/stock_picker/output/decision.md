The companies that were not selected and why:

*   Fireworks AI: Fireworks AI is a generative AI platform noted for its fast and efficient inference engine. While it has strong backing and a focus on open-source AI deployment, its investment potential is slightly lower than Anysphere.
*   Thinking Machine Labs: Thinking Machine Labs is a stealth AI startup founded in 2024 by former OpenAI CTO Mira Murati. While it has the potential to be a major player in the AI research space, it is still in its early stages, making it a riskier investment compared to Anysphere.
*   Sakana AI: Sakana AI is a Japanese AI company distinguished by its nature-inspired approach to AI model development. Although it has a novel approach and strategic backing, it is more focused on the Japanese market, which may limit its overall growth potential compared to Anysphere.
*   DeepL: DeepL is a leading language AI company known for accurate machine translation. While it has a strong market position and potential for an IPO, it faces significant competition from Google Translate, making it a less attractive investment than Anysphere.
*   World Labs: World Labs is developing spatial intelligence AI models. Although it has secured substantial funding and has a pioneer in computer vision as its founder, its focus on spatial intelligence is a more niche area compared to the broader AI applications of Anysphere.
